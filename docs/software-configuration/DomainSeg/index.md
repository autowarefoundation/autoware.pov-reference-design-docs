# DomainSeg

## Overview

DomainSeg addresses on the challenges on identifying roadwork scenes and construction objects, delivering robust safety perception across urban driving scenarios, highways and even unstrcutured roads. It is able to adapt to challenging weather conditions such as snow and low-light, and is robust to edge cases such as detection of traffic cones that have been knocked over by other cars. 

## Requirements
