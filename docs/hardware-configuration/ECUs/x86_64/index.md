# X86-based ECUs

The page lists the X86-bsaed ECUs being tested for PoV, which can meet the computation capacity requirement of PoV but does not overprovision the resource requirements.

Another page on [Autoware Document](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/reference-hw/ad-computers/) lists the ECUs being for other use scenarios.

(Candidates of the ECUs to be used by the LSA in the alphabetical order)
