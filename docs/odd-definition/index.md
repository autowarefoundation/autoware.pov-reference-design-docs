# ODD Definition

(To be completed)

Operation Domain Definition (ODD) describes the use scenarios for the vehicles to be designed and deployed. The deployed system should meet the ODD to be functionality completed. This section describes the ODD user scenarios for PoV.

The user scenario we focus on is the highway: 2 lanes of traffic or more, with contraflow traffic separated by a barrier or divider.

TODO: Is there any other scenarios?

TODO: How to define the different edge cases?
